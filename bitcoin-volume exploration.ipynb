    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "From this short analysis, looking at the period between September 2015 and December 2017, we can see that there has been a strong price increase for both currencies. As for the causes of the increase in price, at this stage I don't have enough information to model the issue correctly and pinpoint the specific causes for the increase in both price and trading volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would speculate that maybe the [increasing insterest from big institutional players](https://www.coindesk.com/8-banking-giants-bitcoin-blockchain) such as Barclays, BNP Paribas, or Citi Bank have increased the demand for cryptocurrencies. There are players that have even created their own [trading desk for bitcoins](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/goldman-sachs-launching-trading-desk-for-bitcoin-report-says.html). If players of this size enter a specific market we can foresee an increase in market action and a strong increase in price. This is just a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the second question, as we can see from the data, the growing interest and validation that bitcoin generated to the cryptomarkets has had a positive effect on other cryptocurrencies. Although, bitcoin grew by a multiple of 56.5, ethereum - during the same span of time grew 554x.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my perspective the future is uncertain. We could see a growth activity and interest from more institutional and retail investors, as well as growing volume of crypto based commerce. Hence driving the market action (price and volumes) to an even stronger growth. However, there are questions about the stability of cryptocurrencies - both from an economic perspective (such as the difficulties involved in performing fundamental analysis on cryptocurrencies) as well as technological perspective (like the question, is there a point where the size of the distributed ledger and processing power needed to manage transactions efficiently exceeds our current computing resources available). These variables introduce an element of uncertainty regaring the fate and future of cryptocurrencies.\n"
